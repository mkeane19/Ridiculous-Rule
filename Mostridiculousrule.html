<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
<p>I attended a Catholic middle school, where we had pretty strict rules.</p>
<h2>Silly Rules</h2>
<p>One rule was that we couldn't wear visible makeup (heavy eyeshadow etc,). Another was that we could not wear jewelry with the exception of post earrings (for girls) a watch, and religious items.</p>
<h3>One of the Weirdest Rules in my opinion</h3>
<p>One of the weirdest rules for me was that we were not allowed to paint our nails. We weren't even allowed a clear coat. They never explained to us the reasoning behind this. Was it that our red or purple or green nails were distractions and hiindered the education of other students?</p>
<h4>Their Solution</h4>
<p>If someone was caught with painted nails, they would be forced to remove it. Some teachers would send students to the nurses office, while others kept nail polish remover in thier rooms in order to enforce the rules.</p>
